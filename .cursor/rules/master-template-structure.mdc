# Master Template Required Structure

Every master radiology report template MUST contain these sections in this order.

---

## DEMOGRAPHICS:

Required fields:
- **Facility:** Facility Name
- **Patient:** Patient Name, DOB/Age, Sex
- **Referring:** Referring Physician
- **Exam:** CPT Code + Description (e.g., "70450 CT Head/Brain")

---

## CLINICAL INFORMATION:

Required fields:
- **History:** HPI / PMHx (includes clinical questions)
- **Indication:** Indication for the study

Note: Clinical questions should be embedded in History and Indication, not a separate field.

---

## TECHNIQUE:

Inline format showing procedure and materials:
- **Procedure:** Technique picklist (TEC-{modality}-{region})
- **Contrast:** Contrast/materials picklist (CONTRAST-{modality})

Includes: procedures performed, contrast media, radiopharmaceuticals, medications, devices.

---

## COMPARISON:

- Prior Studies (merge field from PACS/EMR)

---

## FINDINGS:

First item is always Quality/Limitations, followed by anatomic components:

1. **Quality:** Limitations picklist (any factors affecting interpretation)
2. **Anatomic Components:** Each with one or more picklists

Example for CT Head:
```
Quality: Picklist: QUALITY-ct
Brain Parenchyma: Picklist: Brain Parenchyma (15) Picklist: Mass Effect (6)
Ventricles and Extra-axial Spaces: Picklist: Ventricles (7) Picklist: Extra-axial Spaces (8)
Calvarium and Sinuses: Picklist: Calvarium (7) Picklist: Paranasal Sinuses (4) Picklist: Mastoids (2)
```

---

## IMPRESSION:

Simple format:
- **Diagnosis:** Default text (e.g., "Normal exam.")

The impression is populated by AI or radiologist. Default is "Normal exam."

---

## Template Structure in JSON

```json
{
  "primary_cpt": "70450",
  "description": "CT Head/Brain",
  "demographics": {
    "facility": "merge_field",
    "patient": "merge_field",
    "referring": "merge_field",
    "exam": "{{cpt}} {{description}}"
  },
  "clinical_information": {
    "history": "merge_field",
    "indication": "merge_field"
  },
  "technique": {
    "procedure": "TEC-ct-head",
    "contrast": "CONTRAST-ct"
  },
  "comparison": "merge_field",
  "findings": {
    "quality": "QUALITY-ct",
    "components": [
      "brain_parenchyma",
      "ventricles_extraaxial",
      "calvarium_sinuses"
    ]
  },
  "impression": {
    "default_text": "Normal exam."
  }
}
```

## Key Principles

1. **Quality is a finding** - Always first item under FINDINGS
2. **No AI badges** - Don't display "AI Generated" labels
3. **Multiple picklists per component** - Anatomic findings can have multiple picklists inline
4. **Inline technique** - Procedure and Contrast on same line
5. **Simple impression** - Just diagnosis text, no differential/recommendations as separate fields
