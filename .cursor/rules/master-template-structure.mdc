## Template Structure in JSON

Master templates must follow this section hierarchy:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "demographics": { /* merge fields */ },
    "facility": { /* merge field */ },
    "exam_info": { /* merge fields for exam name, date, time */ },

  },
  "clinical_information": {
    "hpi": { /* merge field or component */ },
    "indication": { /* merge field or component */ },
    "clinical_questions": { /* component */ }
  },
  "technique": { /* picklist/component for procedure description */ },
  "comparison": { /* merge field + picklist for prior studies */ },
  "findings": [
    /* Array of finding components organized by anatomy */
  ],
  "quality": { /* component for limitations */ },
  "impression": {
    "default_text": "Normal exam.",
    "source": "AI Generated",
    "includes_diagnosis": true,
    "includes_differential": true,
    "includes_recommendations": true
  }
}
```
